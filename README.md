This project is not a finished or completed project.
The main purpose of the project is to set an example especially for those who want to use the Ursina game engine.
However, the project is open to improvements and new ideas.
An artificial intelligence model for the currently developed Tank object is trained in the train.py file in the project, but the model is not added to the project as this file currently only trains the tank to hit the target.
